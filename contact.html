        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <strong><hr /></strong>
        <p>My name is Christelle Kanguemba Tsala, a 26-year-old charming woman born and raised in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Central Africa. Currently, I live in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, with my family. I graduated with a high GPA from the Business and Entrepreneurial School at the Catholic University of Congo. My biggest dream is to become a real estate investor, holding properties in different countries across the globe.
    
            I have a passion for luxury, which led me to deepen my knowledge about LVMH products by enrolling in one of their top training certification programs. Through this program, I gained a comprehensive understanding of their products, which has further fueled my interest in the luxury market.
            
            In addition to my interest in real estate and luxury goods, I am also a big fan of makeup and fashion. I aspire to create my own makeup line and salon in the future. My goal is to provide employment opportunities for young women like myself who are struggling to find jobs in my home country. I believe in empowering others and making a positive impact on their lives.
            
            If youâ€™d like to see more about me, please visit my social media pages where I post about my lifestyle and fun activities. I love sharing my journey and connecting with others who share similar interests.</p>
